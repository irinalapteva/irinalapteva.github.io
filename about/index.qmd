### Irina Lapteva (she/her) {.center}

I strongly believe in power of the arts to bring people together. In particular, the performing arts have always been at the core of my life and a key part of my identity. As an indigenous former ballerina with 2 Master Degrees and more than 15 years of work experience in nonprofit performing arts organizations, I am uniquely suited to innovate and enhance the arts and education landscape. Driven by a deep passion and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, I aim to create transformative experiences that resonate with diverse communities and contribute to the enduring success of organizations and artistic excellence.

Born in Siberia I represent the Sakha Diaspora in America by promoting Siberian indigenous culture and arts. In addition, I am a long time member of the Association of Performing Arts Professionals (APAP) and CID UNESCO, the International Dance Council. I have worked as a consultant for dance companies and ballet competitions.Â And most recently I worked as the Managing Director of CityDance Conservatory at Strathmore for 6 years and as the Education Program Director at the Brighton Ballet Theater in NYC for 8 years.
