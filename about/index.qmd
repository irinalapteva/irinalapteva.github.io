I strongly believe in power of the arts to bring people together. In particular, the performing arts have always been at the core of my life and a key part of my identity. As an indigenous former ballerina with 2 Master Degrees and more than 15 years of work experience in nonprofit performing arts organizations, I am uniquely suited to innovate and enhance the arts and education landscape. Driven by a deep passion and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, I aim to create transformative experiences that resonate with diverse communities and contribute to the enduring success of the arts.
