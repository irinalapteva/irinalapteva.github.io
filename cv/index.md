### Mission

I strongly believe in power of the arts to bring people together. In
particular, the performing arts have always been at the core of my life
and a key part of my identity. As an indigenous former ballerina with 2
Master Degrees and more than 15 years of work experience in nonprofit
performing arts organizations, I am uniquely suited to innovate and
enhance the arts and education landscape. Driven by a deep passion and a
strong entrepreneurial spirit, I aim to create transformative
experiences that resonate with diverse communities and contribute to the
enduring success of organizations and artistic excellence.
