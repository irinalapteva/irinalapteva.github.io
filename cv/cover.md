Hiring Committee  
The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts  
2700 F Street NW  
Washington, D.C. 20566

Dear Hiring Committee,

I am excited to apply for the Teaching Artist Strategy and
Implementation Assistant Manager position at The John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts. With a career spanning over 15 years in
nonprofit performing arts organizations, coupled with my background as
an indigenous former ballerina, I am eager to contribute to your
esteemed institution.

My professional journey has been deeply rooted in the performing arts
and education. As Managing Director at CityDance Conservatory, I led
diverse programs, managed budgets, and worked closely with a team of
teaching artists. I successfully executed productions at prestigious
venues such as the Kennedy Center and adapted to challenges, including
transitioning more than 100 weekly classes and several summer intensives
to online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. I organized teacher
orientations and training and would higher and supervise all the faculty
and guest artists.

At Brighton Ballet Theater, I managed after-school programs in public
schools from elementary to high school, organized master classes,
workshops, and lectures at colleges and senior centers, and facilitated
field trips for public students to take classes in studios. My teaching
experience includes cultural specific dances, ballet, contemporary, and
Pilates for all ages, demonstrating my versatility and commitment to the
arts, I have taught for more than 18 years already.

I am proficient in Microsoft Office and various computer programs, with
strong skills in database management, budget oversight, contracts, grant
writing and research. These technical skills complement my extensive
experience in arts administration and education, making me well-prepared
to contribute to The Kennedy Center’s educational initiatives.

The Kennedy Center’s mission to connect with artists and communities
through transformative arts experiences aligns perfectly with my career
goals. I am confident in my ability to support the Changing Education
Through the Arts (CETA) team and help advance your educational programs.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the
opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills align with the goals
of The Kennedy Center.

Sincerely,  
Irina Lapteva
